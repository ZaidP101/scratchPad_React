# My Learning Projects

This repository contains all my **projects and learnings** as I explore **React** and frontend development concepts.  
Each folder/project represents a hands-on practice of different topics, helping me build a strong foundation step by step.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Learning React
- Understanding the basics of React.
- Creating components (functional & reusable).
- Writing JSX and managing props.

### ðŸ”¹ React Structure
- Standard file and folder structure.
- Splitting UI and logic into components.
- Organizing projects for clarity.

### ðŸ”¹ Working (React Fundamentals)
- Rendering data dynamically.
- Passing props to components.
- Conditional rendering.
- State management with `useState`.

### ðŸ”¹ Hooks
- `useState` â†’ Managing component-level state.
- `useEffect` â†’ Side effects like fetching data, localStorage, etc.
- Hook rules and proper usage.
- `useRef`
- `useCallback`

### ðŸ”¹ React Router
- Setting up client-side navigation.
- Using `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Link`, `NavLink`.
- Understanding nested routes and URL params.

### ðŸ”¹ Custom Hooks
- Writing reusable logic across components.
- Using naming convention: `useSomething`.
- Example: form handling, localStorage management.

### ðŸ”¹ Context API
- Creating global state without prop drilling.
- Steps learned:
  1. **Create Context** (with initial signatures).
  2. **Custom Hook** â†’ useContext wrapper for easy usage.
  3. **Provider** â†’ Supply real values & functions.
- Practical implementation with a **Todo App** (Add, Update, Delete, Complete).

## About This Repo
This repo serves as a **learning journal**.  
As I explore more topics in React, Iâ€™ll keep adding projects and notes here.

### ðŸ”¹ Redux Todo Mini Project
- Learning centralized state management with **Redux Toolkit**.
- Understanding how the **store** holds the app state and how **reducers** update that state.
- Using React-Redux hooks:
  - `useDispatch` to send actions (add or remove todos).
  - `useSelector` to read state data (list of todos) from the store.
- Building a Todo app to practice the core Redux principles of unidirectional data flow and predictable state updates.
